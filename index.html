				<p class="push--top">It’s a fact that most bad guys go for the “easy” targets, the innocent and defenseless, those who have little or no protection from gunﬁre, explosions, and other physical harm. Unfortunately more and more schools are becoming targets of such violence.</p>
				<p class="push--top">But a school shouldn’t look like a fortress. By nature, schools are designed for aesthetics; students learn better when they are comfortable in their surroundings. Yet these characteristics also make schools highly vulnerable to attacks.</p>
				<p class="push--top">Classroom Armor&trade; is designed to complement the decor of the classroom itself. In most instances our armor is invisible; but when a violent incident occurs, Classroom Armor&trade; can mean the difference between life and death.</p>

			<div class="hr-short"></div>
			<p class="push--bottom black">LifeSafe&trade; began over a decade ago when a handful of brilliant minds created a collection of seemingly unrelated products... doors, windows, podiums, desks, chairs, even clipboards... but if you looked closely you would have found that all of these things had one thing in common: they were designed to stop bullets.</p>
			<p class="push--bottom black">For years we have provided peace of mind to military and government organizations who trust LifeSafe&trade; to protect their people from danger; but from the beginning the creators of LifeSafe&trade; wanted to make a greater impact on society as a whole. All of us as fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, grandparents, and friends, want to protect our loved ones, and protect ourselves on behalf of those who depend on us. Unfortunately there are incidents every day where innocent lives are threatened and lost, lives that could have been saved with the right protection.</p>
			<p class="push--bottom black">Today, we at LifeSafe&trade; are committed to providing peace of mind for all human life by making our trusted technology and designs accessible to the public.</p>
