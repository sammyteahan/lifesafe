				<p class="push--top">It’s a fact that most bad guys go for the “easy” targets, the innocent and defenseless, those who have little or no protection from gunﬁre, explosions, and other physical harm. Unfortunately more and more schools are becoming targets of such violence.</p>
				<p class="push--top">But a school shouldn’t look like a fortress. By nature, schools are designed for aesthetics; students learn better when they are comfortable in their surroundings. Yet these characteristics also make schools highly vulnerable to attacks.</p>
				<p class="push--top">Classroom Armor&trade; is designed to complement the decor of the classroom itself. In most instances our armor is invisible; but when a violent incident occurs, Classroom Armor&trade; can mean the difference between life and death.</p>
